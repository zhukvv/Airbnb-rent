# Airbnb rent
### My first Changellenge course project
The task was to make a list of flats to live in for a company's employees that come to the conference in Boston. The requirements were
- to host TOP-managers separately from each other and other co-workers,
- to suggest the solution according to the given budget and even save some money if possible,
- to make a proposal of preferred means of transport for all employees to get to the conference and back.

I have uploaded the final Excel file, where you can find the story of our research and some SQL code that helped to import and clean data. 

To cut a long story short, I also uploaded our presentation for you to read the solution briefly.
